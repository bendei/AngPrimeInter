1.  t.registerOnChange is not a function:
   
    Oka: but if you use FormBuilder, you would see this when you added a control to FormGroup in your component and named it "A",
     but then either forgot to add input with formControlName="A" to your template, or formControlName for the intended input is not A, 
     or empty, or not present.
